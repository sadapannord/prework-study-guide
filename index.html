        <ul>
          <li> JavaScript or JS is case sensitve</li>
          <li>JS code is embedded in the "body" portion of HTML, usually "footer"</li>
          <li>Instructions are called statements, and always end with semicolon (best practice)</li>
          <li>When wanting to add a comment // denotes a one line comment</li>
            <ul>
              <li>/* is used for multi-line comments, next line will be *, and last will end in */</li>
              
            </ul>
          <li>"var" is used to declare a variable</li>
            <li>console.log is a 2 part command</li>
            <ul>
              <li>console refers to the test environment used to check the code</li>
              <li>.log is the method (instructions), which in this case means log what is written in the ()</li>
            </ul>
          <li>ChromeDevTools allows you to see the code in the browser, will right click and click "inspect" </li>
            <ul>
              <li> The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+I</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Will want to use conditional statements in JS</li>
          <li>"if" code will only excute if the condition is met</li>
          <li>"else if" is used for multiple conditions, looks for truthy statements, once it finds one, it will stop running</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A truthy statement is a statement that is not falsy</li>
              <li>A falsy statement is a statement that has a value of 0,-0,On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or Boolean false</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Three equals signs (===) sets a straight equality operator, checks if 2 values are equal, and will return a Boolean true/false</li>
          <li>An identified is the name of a variable</li>
          <li>An array is a list of values, and they do not have to be the same data type</li>
            <ul>
              <li>ie. var studentInfo=["Lu",54,true];</li>
            </ul>
          <li>"for" is a loop using a predictable pattern of indicies (multiple index) to perform a task on all items by allowing a single code block to be used over and over</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Will use a conditional statement (ie "if") to stop the flow</li>
            </ul>
          <li>An index indicates the place of a value in an array (ie hello, hi, bye   hello=0, hi=1, bye=2) </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Indicies always start at 0 in JS</li>
            </ul>
          <li>"for" loop has 3 statements ie for(var x=0; x<"shapes.length"; x++;) </li>
            <ul>
              <li>1st is the starting point, here var x=0 means start at the beginning of the array</li>
              <li>2nd is a condition using Boolean values, here as long as the variable is shorter than the array it will continue</li>
              <li>3rd tells the value of x, here x++ means x+1, just upping the value of x by one each time</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The "for" statement is followed by a code block in {} to tell what to do with the outputs</li>
            <ul>
              <li> ie. log it in the console</li>
            </ul>
          <li>"function" tells JS that the upcoming text is a function, so will type    function "name of function"()</li>
          <li>"Math" (capital) is a built in object that has properties for mathematical constants and functions</li>
            <ul>
              <li>ie Math.floor outputs the largest interger that is less than or equal to x</li>
              <li>ie Math.random is a pseudo random number between 0 and 1</li>
