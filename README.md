# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This webpage was developed to help in the prework process for a coding bootcamp. It allowed the student (myself) to follow along with basic commands in the command interface, in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In creating this webpage I learned the basic differences in the various languages that CLI, HTML, CSS and JS use, and allowed me to actually see and understand what the commands I was reading about do. 


## Installation

## Usage
