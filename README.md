# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This webpage was developed to help in the prework process for a coding bootcamp. It allowed the student (myself) to follow along with basic commands in the command interface, in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In creating this webpage I learned the basic differences in the various languages that CLI, HTML, CSS and JS use, and allowed me to actually see and understand what the commands I was reading about do. 


## Installation

## Usage

This webpage contains the notes that I took during the prework lessons. There are 4 topics which can be learned about, with a suggestion what to study first in DevTools.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
